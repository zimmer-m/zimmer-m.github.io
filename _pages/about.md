I am a second-year PhD candidate at the [Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/math) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Sebastian Pokutta](http://www.pokutta.com/) and work as a doctoral researcher in the [Interactive Optimization and Learning (IOL)](https://iol.zib.de/) research lab at the [Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB)](https://www.zib.de/). My research interests are centered around Machine Learning and Optimization in general. In particular, I am interested in *Compression of Neural Networks*, *Explainability (XAI)*, *Fairness in AI* as well as *first-order optimization*. Since 2022, I am also a member of the [BMS graduate school](https://www.math-berlin.de), which is part of the [MATH+ Cluster of Excellence](https://mathplus.de/).

Before joining IOL in 2020 as a student research assistant, I worked on *Nash Flows over Time* together with Leon Sering at the [Combinatorial Optimization and Graph Algorithms Group (COGA)](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/coga/) at TU Berlin. During my BSc and MSc in Mathematics, which I both received from TU Berlin, I got the chance to intern in the research groups of [Prof. Sergio de Rosa at Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II](https://www.pastalab.unina.it/) and [Prof. Marco Mondelli at IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/).
