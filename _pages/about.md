**Research:** My research interests focus on Deep Learning, Efficient ML, and Optimization. Specifically, I work on enhancing the efficiency of large Neural Networks through sparsity, pruning, quantization, and low-rank optimization. Additionally, I am interested in Federated Learning, Explainability & Fairness, as well as applying ML to solve pure mathematics problems. Please take a look at my [list of publications](/publications) and feel free to reach out for questions or potential collaborations!

**Previously:** Before joining IOL as a student researcher in 2020, I worked on *Nash Flows over Time* with Leon Sering at the [COGA Group](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/coga/) at TU Berlin. During my BSc and MSc in Mathematics at TU Berlin, I got the chance to intern in the research groups of Prof. Sergio de Rosa at [Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II](https://www.pastalab.unina.it/) and Prof. Marco Mondelli at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/). Since 2022, I have been a member of the [BMS graduate school](https://www.math-berlin.de), part of the [MATH+ Cluster of Excellence](https://mathplus.de/). You can [find my full CV here](/cv).
