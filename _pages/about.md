**Research:** My research primarily focuses on developing methods to enhance the <a href="/#efficiency" class="tag-link">compute and memory efficiency</a> of large Neural Networks through techniques like sparsity, pruning, and quantization. While this work aims to make Deep Learning more sustainable, I also leverage large models to address <a href="/#sustainability" class="tag-link">sustainability challenges</a>, such as creating global canopy height maps for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation. I'm also interested in using <a href="/#ai4science" class="tag-link">Deep Learning for scientific discovery</a>, particularly for solving pure mathematical problems. Additionally, I worked on <a href="/#federated-learning" class="tag-link">Federated Learning</a>, <a href="/#interpretability" class="tag-link">Interpretability</a>, and <a href="/#optimization" class="tag-link">Optimization</a>. Please take a look at my <a href="/#all" class="tag-link">list of publications</a> and feel free to reach out for questions or potential collaborations!

**Previously:** Before joining IOL as a student researcher in 2020, I worked on combinatorial optimization problems with Leon Sering at the [COGA Group](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/coga/) at TU Berlin. During my BSc and MSc in Mathematics at TU Berlin, I got the chance to intern in the research groups of Prof. Sergio de Rosa at [Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II](https://www.pastalab.unina.it/) and Prof. Marco Mondelli at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/). Since 2022, I have been a member of the [BMS graduate school](https://www.math-berlin.de), part of the [MATH+ Cluster of Excellence](https://mathplus.de/). You can [find my full CV here](/cv).
