**Research:** My research focuses on the <a href="/#efficiency" class="tag-link">efficiency</a> of neural networks — from weight sparsity and quantization to architectural efficiency and speculative decoding. I'm also very interested in using Deep Learning for <a href="/#ai4science" class="tag-link">scientific discovery (AI4Science/AI4Math)</a> and to address <a href="/#sustainability" class="tag-link">sustainability challenges</a> such as forest monitoring. Further topics I'm interested in include <a href="/#optimization" class="tag-link">Optimization</a> and Agentic AI. At ZIB, I lead the [iol.LEARN](https://iol.zib.de/research/iol-learn.html) Deep Learning group. Please take a look at my <a href="/#all" class="tag-link">list of publications</a> and feel free to reach out for questions or potential collaborations! You can find TLDRs of some of my papers on my [blog](/blog) and a collection of interesting links and AI news [here](/ai_news).


**Previously:** I studied Mathematics at TU Berlin (BSc 2017, MSc 2021), with a semester abroad at the Università di Bologna. During my studies, I worked on combinatorial optimization with Leon Sering at the [COGA Group](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/coga/) and interned in the research groups of Prof. Sergio de Rosa at [Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II](https://www.pastalab.unina.it/) and Prof. Marco Mondelli at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/). I joined the [IOL Lab](https://iol.zib.de) in 2020 as a student researcher, became a doctoral researcher in 2021, and have led the Deep Learning research group since 2024. I am also a member of the [Berlin Mathematical School](https://www.math-berlin.de), affiliated with the [MATH+ Cluster of Excellence](https://mathplus.de/). You can [find my full CV here](/cv).
