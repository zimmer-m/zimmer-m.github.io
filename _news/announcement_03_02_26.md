title: "Three New Preprints on Semantic Geometry, Frank-Wolfe Bounds, and Patchworked Curves"
---

Three new preprints online:
- [From Associations to Activations: Comparing Behavioral and Hidden-State Semantic Geometry in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00628)
- [Lower Bounds for Frank-Wolfe on Strongly Convex Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04378)
- [121 Patchworked Curves of Degree Seven](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06888)
