  abstract      = {Solving systems of polynomial equations, particularly those with finitely many solutions, is a crucial challenge across many scientific fields. Traditional methods like Gröbner and Border bases are fundamental but suffer from high computational costs, which have motivated recent Deep Learning approaches to improve efficiency, albeit at the expense of output correctness. In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which reduces the number of tokens to encode an n-variate polynomial by a factor of O(n). Our learning approach is data efficient, stable, and a practical enhancement to traditional computer algebra algorithms and symbolic computation.},

  abstract      = {Real-world data often exhibits unknown or approximate symmetries, yet existing equivariant networks must commit to a fixed transformation group prior to training, e.g., continuous SO(2) rotations. This mismatch degrades performance when the actual data symmetries differ from those in the transformation group. We introduce RECON, a framework to discover each input's intrinsic symmetry distribution from unlabeled data. RECON leverages class-pose decompositions and applies a data-driven normalization to align arbitrary reference frames into a common natural pose, yielding directly comparable and interpretable symmetry descriptors. We demonstrate effective symmetry discovery on 2D image benchmarks and -- for the first time -- extend it to 3D transformation groups, paving the way towards more flexible equivariant modeling.},

However, existing methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks (canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping). The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong low-shot capabilities with performances near or better than state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.},

In this paper, we establish a connection between manifold learning and computational algebra by demonstrating how vanishing ideals can characterize the latent manifolds of deep networks. To that end, we propose a new neural architecture that (i) truncates a pretrained network at an intermediate layer, (ii) approximates each class manifold via polynomial generators of the vanishing ideal, and (iii) transforms the resulting latent space into linearly separable features through a single polynomial layer. The resulting models have significantly fewer layers than their pretrained baselines, while maintaining comparable accuracy, achieving higher throughput, and utilizing fewer parameters. Furthermore, drawing on spectral complexity analysis, we derive sharper theoretical guarantees for generalization, showing that our approach can in principle offer tighter bounds than standard deep networks. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

(2022) suggests that the Stochastic Frank-Wolfe (SFW) algorithm is particularly suited for training state-of-the-art models that are robust to compression. We propose leveraging $k$-support norm ball constraints and demonstrate significant improvements over the results of Miao et al. (2022) in the case of unstructured pruning. We also extend these ideas to the structured pruning domain and propose novel approaches to both ensure robustness to the pruning of convolutional filters as well as to low-rank tensor decompositions of convolutional layers. In the latter case, our approach performs on-par with nuclear-norm regularization baselines while requiring only half of the computational resources. Our findings also indicate that the robustness of SFW-trained models largely depends on the gradient rescaling of the learning rate and we establish a theoretical foundation for that practice.},

While quantization has proven successful in reducing the memory footprint of LLMs, unstructured pruning introduces overhead by requiring the non-pruned weights' location to be encoded. This overhead hinders the efficient combination of quantization and unstructured pruning, especially for smaller batch sizes common in inference scenarios. To address this, we propose the CS256 storage format, which offers a better balance between space efficiency and hardware acceleration compared to existing formats. CS256 partitions the weight matrix into tiles and uses a hierarchical indexing scheme to locate non-zero values, reducing the overhead associated with storing sparsity patterns. Our preliminary results with one-shot pruning of LLMs show that CS256 matches the performance of unstructured sparsity while being more hardware-friendly.},

In this work, we study the performance of such approaches in the byzantine setting, where a subset of the clients act in an adversarial manner aiming to disrupt the learning process. We show that KD-based FL algorithms are remarkably resilient and analyze how byzantine clients can influence the learning process compared to Federated Averaging. Based on these insights, we introduce two new byzantine attacks and demonstrate that they are effective against prior byzantine-resilient methods. Additionally, we propose FilterExp, a novel method designed to enhance the byzantine resilience of KD-based FL algorithms and demonstrate its efficacy.

  abstract      = {Neural networks can be significantly compressed by pruning, leading to sparse models requiring considerably less storage and floating-point operations while maintaining predictive performance. Model soups (Wortsman et al., 2022) improve generalization and out-of-distribution performance by averaging the parameters of multiple models into a single one without increased inference time. However, identifying models in the same loss basin to leverage both sparsity and parameter averaging is challenging, as averaging arbitrary sparse models reduces the overall sparsity due to differing sparse connectivities. In this work, we address these challenges by demonstrating that exploring a single retraining phase of Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) with varying hyperparameter configurations, such as batch ordering or weight decay, produces models that are suitable for averaging and share the same sparse connectivity by design. Averaging these models significantly enhances generalization performance compared to their individual components. Building on this idea, we introduce Sparse Model Soups (SMS), a novel method for merging sparse models by initiating each prune-retrain cycle with the averaged model of the previous phase. SMS maintains sparsity, exploits sparse network benefits being modular and fully parallelizable, and substantially improves IMP's performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that SMS can be adapted to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art pruning during training approaches.},

  abstract      = {Neural Networks can be effectively compressed through pruning, significantly reducing storage and compute demands while maintaining predictive performance. Simple yet effective methods like magnitude pruning remove less important parameters and typically require a costly retraining procedure to restore performance. However, with the rise of LLMs, full retraining has become infeasible due to memory and compute constraints. This study challenges the practice of retraining all parameters by showing that updating a small subset of highly expressive parameters can suffice to recover or even enhance performance after pruning. Surprisingly, retraining just 0.01%-0.05% of the parameters in GPT-architectures can match the performance of full retraining across various sparsity levels, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements, and enabling retraining of models with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU in minutes. To bridge the gap to full retraining in the high sparsity regime, we introduce two novel LoRA variants that, unlike standard LoRA, allow merging adapters back without compromising sparsity. Going a step further, we show that these methods can be applied for memory-efficient layer-wise reconstruction, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art retraining-free methods like Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023).

We place these findings in the context of the results of Li et al.

Improving on existing retraining approaches, we additionally propose a method to adaptively select the initial value of the linear schedule. Going a step further, we propose similarly imposing a budget on the initial dense training phase and show that the resulting simple and efficient method is capable of outperforming significantly more complex or heavily parameterized state-of-the-art approaches that attempt to sparsify the network during training. These findings not only advance our understanding of the retraining phase, but more broadly question the belief that one should aim to avoid the need for retraining and reduce the negative effects of ‘hard’ pruning by incorporating the sparsification process into the standard training.},

The flow dynamics of both models are very similar with the main difference that the simulation is discrete in terms of vehicles and time while the flows over time model considers continuous flows and continuous time. This raises the question whether Nash flows over time are the limit of the convergence process when decreasing the vehicle and time step size in the simulation coherently.
